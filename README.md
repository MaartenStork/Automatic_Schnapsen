# Automatic Schnapsen

This GitHub repository is dedicated to the development of automated bots for the card-based strategy game Schnapsen. It features a variety of Python scripts that support the game's functionality, including strategies for bot behavior, gameplay mechanics, and tools for visualizing strategies. The repository also includes comprehensive documentation and testing scripts to ensure the bots perform optimally under different game scenarios. My additions have focused on adding different strategies to current bots.
